# Individual Project - Henry Food

<p>This is my first individual project. I have used an external api which has a los of information and i filtered the data to get what i needed. I had only three weeks to finish it and I could make it. The Food App allaws users to create new recipes whith the same types of data as the external api has. users can also search recipes, filter them through de different diets, or change the order (a-z / z-a / best score / worst score / best recipes). On the home page you can see 9 recipes by page in wich it recipe has it's score, image, health-score, diets and name. Aditionally, if you click on a recipe, you can see the same properties plus the step by step of the recipe. I hope you enjoy it. </p>
<p>As soon as I finish the e-commerce i'm working on, i promiss i'll deploy this project so you can try it!</p>
